{!-- Utility embed to get the previous entry when:

	1) The tutorial page has a previous sibling
	2) That sibling has children
	
	So you need to grab the last child of that previous sibling for the link 
	
	Double embed required b/c all of this is in module tags, so lots of late-ish parsing
	
	Top template can grab the previous id w/ exp:structure:siblings
	
		--> Next embed can grab the children with exp:structure:child_ids
			
			--> This embed can use that to pass back a single link
	
	
	--}
