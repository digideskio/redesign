{!-- 404 --}
{!-- Redirect to /404/ if there are extra segments in the URL 
	REMOVED LJR 26 March 2012
		I think this was doing more harm than good.
		Structure could throw a 404 with many, many segments that were all being redirected to /{segment_1}/
		Better to just serve up the page, not muck with the URL, and show the 404 error
