/*
 * Sticky Footer with no restrictions on the size of the footer area like traditional solutions
 * 
 * Flexbox is awesome.

 * https://github.com/philipwalton/solved-by-flexbox/blob/master/_sass/components/_site.scss
 *
 * I've made a modification here to account for some performance issues with scripts adding elements to the <body>, especially on longer pages in Firefox
 * Basically, don't set display:flex on the <body> element directly.
 * My fix is to move the whole shebang one layer deeper (html -> body -> .sticky-footer)
 * See: http://jsbin.com/todajate/3/edit

  "IE10 needs an explicitly declared height on both the <body> and <html> elements to trigger correct calculation of heights for flexible containers along the vertical axis of the page. I haven't found any other properties that trigger the correct behavior so far. It doesn't seem to matter which height you set, but 100% seems sensible."
