I'm taking another whack at the website for the [Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration](http://open-services.net/) community. And I'm going to be doing it in public, right here.

## What I'm up to

- [The need for a redesign](./posts/why.html)
- [Sketches and wireframes](./posts/wireframes.html)
- [Concepts for a new logo](./posts/logo.html)
- [The main menu in a mobile-first world](./posts/mobile-first.html)

I'm going have discussions for all the big things in [Github Issues](https://github.com/OSLC/redesign/issues) so you all can have your say.

## Public? Why?

In the end, I'd like this site to remain as a style guide, a test site, and a bit of history available to anyone. And, in the process, you all can keep me honest. 

And it'll be fun. 

In ["Designing in the Open"](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/), Brad Frost spells out some of the benefits of redesigning in the open:

- you have a central place to gather feedback, tips, and resources;
- you'll be continually sharing the work in progress instead of having a "big reveal";
- you're accountable to more people;
- most importantly, you might help someone else:

> By sharing your thoughts, your successes, your failures, your techniques, your process, your resources, you’re able to have a much greater impact on the world than whatever happens to be in your project’s scope.

Count me in.
